# LeagueMatchmaking
A program to balance teams for custom games of League of Legends, still a work in progress

To run this program requires a Riot Games API key. In order to keep the program open and public I have decided to make the API key an enviorment variable and requireing the user to input their own API key as hard coding one would violate Riot's terms of use

To get an API key, register at developer.riotgames.com
Once you have a key, run the program by entering:

Linux/Mac Terminal: source projectfolder/venv/bin/activate API_KEY=Key goes here python GUI.py

Windows Command Prompt/ PowerShell: mypthon\Scripts\activate
